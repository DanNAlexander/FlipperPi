# Self-Updater from GitHub:

# Allows FlipperPi to download updated scripts directly from a GitHub repo, replacing local files. Ex. firmware/network update feature.
# Connects to GitHub over HTTPS.
# Downloads files from a raw URL 
# Saves/overwrites local versions in flipperpi/
# Optionally reboots or relaunches the menu.

# Make a GitHub Repo and follow the FilePathSetup.txt in this project.Youâ€™ll be referencing these raw URLs in the update script.

# Change instances of YOURUSER in the code to your username used in your repo

# Optionally add a version text file in the project to check where you last updated to, etc.
