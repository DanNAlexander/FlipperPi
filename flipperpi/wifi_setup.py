# Wi-Fi Scanner & Connector

# Used to scan nearby Wi-Fi networks and allow the user to choose and connect to one by entering a password; similar to Flipper Zeroâ€™s Wi-Fi devboard management feature.

# Uses nmcli to scan and connect to networks.
# Interactive CLI input for SSID and password.
# Requires NetworkManager (included in Raspberry Pi OS Desktop; can be added to Lite).

# One-Time Setup in BASH:
# sudo apt install network-manager
# sudo systemctl stop dhcpcd
# sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd
# sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
# sudo reboot
